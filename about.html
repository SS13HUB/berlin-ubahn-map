<h1>Berlin U-Bahn Map</h1>

<p>
  The Berlin U-Bahn ([uː.baːn]; short for Untergrundbahn, "underground railway") is a rapid transit railway in Berlin, the capital city of Germany, and a major part of the city's public transport system. Together with the S-Bahn, a network of suburban train lines, and a tram network that operates mostly in the eastern parts of the city, it serves as the main means of transport in the capital.
</p>

<p>
  Opened in 1902, the U-Bahn serves 173 stations spread across ten lines, with a total track length of 151.7 kilometres (94.3 mi), about 80% of which is underground. Trains run every two to five minutes during peak hours, every five minutes for the rest of the day and every ten minutes in the evening. The entire system is maintained and operated by the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe, commonly known as the BVG.

<h2>About this project</h2>

<p>
  This is an interactive representation of the Berlin U-bahn system, inspired by
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skamsie/berlin-subway/master/U-Bahn_Berlin.png">this map</a>
  from 2016, but updated to the 2020 namings and routes.
</p>

<p>
  The map is draggable and scalable. Clicking on a station label brings up an image and information about the station. The information is taken exclusively from the English or German Wikipedia page. At the bottom of each article there is a link to the source.Since some of the pages are cached, the information might not be in sync with the corresponding Wikipedia article.

  The left side bar that holds the article is resizable.
