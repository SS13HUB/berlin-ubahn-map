      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>the project</h3>
      <p>
        This website is an interactive representation of the Berlin U-Bahn
        system inspired by
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skamsie/berlin-subway/master/U-Bahn_Berlin.png">this map</a>
        from 2016, but updated to the 2020 namings and routes. The most notable
        difference is that the Eastern terminus of U3 is now at Warschauer Straße.
        A couple of stations are also called differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        The map is draggable by dragging and scalable by zooming. Clicking on a
        station label brings up an image and information about the station. The
        information is taken from the English or German
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>
        page. At the bottom of each article there is a link to the source.
        Since some of the pages are cached, the information might not be in
        sync with the corresponding Wikipedia article.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sidebar that displays the station information is resizable by
        dragging horizontally, but only on desktop. Once the sidebar is open,
        the 'previous' and 'next' links (or the ← and → keys on the keyboard)
        can be used for moving between stations.
      </p>

      <p>For the implementation details, you can check out the project on
        <a href="https://github.com/skamsie/berlin-ubahn-map">Github</a>.

      <h3>the photos</h3>
      <p>
        In the begging of the project I was only using the default thumbnails
        returned by the Wikipedia API. Some of the photos are old and do not
        reflect the current condition or design of the stations (plus I became
        more and more interested in the U-Bahn due to its rich history),
        hence I decided to go photograph them myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently the U1, U3, U4, U8, U9 lines and almost all of the U2 and U7
        lines use my own photos. For the rest, there is either a link to the
        source (usually <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a>),
        or no link at all, which means the photo is the thumbnail of the
        corresponding Wikipedia page.
      </p>

      <h3>the u-bahn</h3>
      <p>
        The Berlin U-Bahn ([uː.baːn]; short for Untergrundbahn, "underground
        railway") is a rapid transit railway in Berlin, the capital city of
        Germany, and a major part of the city's public transport system.
        Together with the S-Bahn, a network of suburban train lines, and a
        tram network that operates mostly in the eastern parts of the city,
        it serves as the main means of transport in the capital.
      </p>

      <p>
        Opened in 1902, the U-Bahn serves 173 stations spread across ten lines,
        with a total track length of 151.7 kilometres (94.3 mi), about 80% of
        which is underground. Trains run every two to five minutes during peak
        hours, every five minutes for the rest of the day and every ten minutes
        in the evening. Over the course of a year, U-Bahn trains travel 132
        million km (82.0 million mi), and carry over 400 million passengers. In
        2017, 553.1 million passengers rode the U-Bahn. The entire system is
        maintained and operated by the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe, commonly
        known as the BVG.
