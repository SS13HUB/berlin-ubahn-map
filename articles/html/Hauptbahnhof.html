  <b>Hauptbahnhof</b> underground station is a U-Bahn station in Berlin, on the
  <b>U55</b> line. The station is connected to the Berlin Hauptbahnhof, the main
  railway station of the city.
</p>

<p>
  The U-Bahn platforms are presently served only by the U55, which is not
  connected to the rest of the U-Bahn network. It was opened on 8 August 2009.
  This line is operated as a single-track shuttle, and only one of the two
  platform tracks is currently used. The other is behind a metal fence, mounted
  in the ground. Construction of a 2.2 kilometres (1.4 mi) connection to line
  U5 commenced in April 2010 and is expected to be completed in 2020. In the
  long term it is planned to extend the U5 from the main station towards the
  west to Turmstraße and Jungfernheide. Due to lack of funds from the state of
  Berlin, the northwestern continuation is not expected in the near future.
</p>

<p>
  The underground station is in the second level of the main station, and east
  of the deep north-south train platforms (tracks 1-8). It has a central
  platform, which is covered with granite. To exit the platform are three
  stairs, an escalator and a lift. In addition, the Underground Station is
  equipped with tactile paving for accessibility.

<p>
  The platform hall has a length of 140 metres, 11 metres in height and 19
  metres in width, the wall cladding consists of enamel plates which are
  decorated with photographs of the former Berlin head stations. Furthermore,
  colored lighting illuminates the ceiling space above the platform.
</p>

<p>
  Since it is the terminus of the to-be-extended U5, a short two-pronged branch
  railway was built to the north. One of the two sweeping track is located at a
  lockable manhole, through which the U-Bahn carriages can be replaced if
  necessary with a crane. This currently represents the only way to install
  U-Bahn carriages in the tunnel, because the line U55 does not yet connect
  with the rest of the U-Bahn network.
</p>

<p>
  Zoning for an underground line under the Invalidenstraße (U11) is provided
  for at the station, however this is only likely to be constructed in the far
  future.
