  Even though construction was completed in 1994, it took over a decade until
  the subway line U55 went into service in August 2009. In the intervening
  period, the partially completed station with its high ceiling and unusual
  architecture served as a location for cultural events like performances of
  the opera <i>The Magic Flute</i> and saw use as a film set for the
  <i>Resident Evil</i> film series, for <i>Ã†on Flux</i> and for
  <i>Equilibrium</i>.

  As of 2013, only the eastern face of the island platform is open where the
  shuttle service stops in both directions. When the full U5 line completed west
  of Alexanderplatz the western platform face will serve trains towards
  Alexanderplatz and the present eastern platform face will serve trains towards
  Hauptbahnhof.
